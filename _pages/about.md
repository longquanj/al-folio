I am currently an algorithm engineer at Lufax. Before joining it, I worked at Macrowing Inc. as NLP R&D engineer, and at Mainiway AI Lab as NLP research intern, mentored by [Dr. Or Biran](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~orb/) and [Dr. Yassine Benajiba](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yassine-benajiba-0180516/).
