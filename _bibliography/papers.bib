	abstract={Product ontologies - consisting of a taxonomic categorization of product types and lists of attributes that types and products have - are invaluable for analyzing sales, opinions and ratings of items on e-commerce sites. Unfortunately, many international and smaller sites lack such ontologies, and instead feature only coarse high-level categories. We present a Siamese neural model which utilizes such coarse categories to learn a fine-grained hierarchical categorization of products, and jointly extract lists of product attributes from text reviews. We show that our model retains a high accuracy on the categorization task for unseen products and unseen category depths, and as a side effect learns to extract useful product attributes.},

	abstract={Semantic Pattern Similarity is an interesting, though not often encountered NLP task where two sentences are compared not by their specific meaning, but by their more abstract semantic pattern (e.g., preposition or frame). We utilize Siamese Networks to model this task, and show its usefulness in determining SQL patterns for unseen questions in a database-backed question answering scenario. Our approach achieves high accuracy and contains a built-in proxy for confidence, which can be used to keep precision arbitrarily high.},
